# pie-elements

A collection of pies. These packages are pie packages in that they have an optional `configure` and/or `controller` sub package.

## Install

```shell
yarn install # install monorepo dependencies
lerna bootstrap # symlinks any dependencies, uses yarn workspaces to speed up install
```

### pie global

For some of the scripts you'll need the pie cli installed (note that you must use npm to install this)

```shell
npm install -g pie
```

| scripts/info \$pkg | run `pie info` for a package, with watch enabled                        |

> when building make sure all watchers are disabled - we had an issue where a watcher was corrupting the build.

## running

Each package need to be built w/ babel before you can use it.

The following script:

```shell
scripts/info $package
```

Will run a watched babel process and the run `pie info`.

> You need to have `pie>=10.1.1` installed | `npm install -g pie`.

## Tests

All tests are run from the root of the repo.

> Don't add any test `devDependencies` or `jest.config.js` etc in the packages - it's unnecessary and can break the tests.

```shell
npm test
```

# publishing

## canary

```shell
yarn lerna publish --canary --dist-tag $TAG --preid $TAG --force-publish
```
