## Usage

To use this pie, you need to configure it within an Assessment Item. This means that you'll need to add it to the `index.html` and `config.json` files.

```html
<multi-trait-rubric pie-id="1"></multi-trait-rubric>
```

```javascript
{
  elements: {
    'multi-trait-rubric': '@pie-element/multi-trait-rubric@^1.0.0'
  },
  models: [
    {
      id : "1",
      element: 'multi-trait-rubric',
      // more configuration...
    }
  ]
```
