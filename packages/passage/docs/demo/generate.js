  content: `The bicycles go by in twos and threes -<br/> 
  There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn tonight,<br/>
  And there's the half-talk code of mysteries<br/>
  And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.<br/>
  Half-past eight and there is not a spot<br/>
  Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown<br/>
  That might turn out a man or woman, not<br/>
  A footfall tapping secrecies of stone. <br/>
  <p/>
  I have what every poet hates in spite<br/>
  Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.<br/>
  Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight<br/>
  Of being king and government and nation.<br/>
  A road, a mile of kingdom. I am king<br/>
  Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.<br/>
  `
