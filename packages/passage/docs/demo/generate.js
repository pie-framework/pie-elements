It may seem like it does not make any difference. But it does!</p><p></p><p></p><p class="kds-indent">Stretching before exercise increases blood flow to the muscles, getting them ready to work. Stretching between long periods of sitting increases blood flow to inactive muscles. The longer that muscles are inactive, the weaker they become. Every now and then you need to &#34;wake up&#34; inactive muscles by delivering oxygen and nutrients to them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="kds-indent">During weight&#8211;lifting exercise, muscles actually shorten, causing them to feel tight and sore. Stretching helps to lengthen muscles, making one a little less tight and sore.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="kds-indent">If one overworks one side of the body but not the other such as from carrying a backpack on one side, that side tightens causing one to feel unbalanced. Stretching can help bring balance back to the body.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="kds-indent">Finally, stretching helps prevent injuries. Stretching improves one&#39;s range of motion at the joints, such as at the ankles, knees, shoulders, and neck. Otherwise, if these areas get tight or weak, and one suddenly strains them, they can get injured.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="kds-indent">So whether you are exercising, sitting, or carrying a heavy backpack around, take a few minutes to stretch.</p><p></p><p></p>',
