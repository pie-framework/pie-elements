      "text": "<h3>Excerpt from <i>Sybil, or the Two Nations</i></h3><h5>by Benjamin  Disraeli</h5><div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\"><em>In this 1845 excerpt from a novel, a man named Simmons walks the streets, tapping on windows. He speaks with another man who works as a weaver. The man talks about his life and how it has changed since he moved from his village to an industrial town in England.</em></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     A man muffled up in a thick coat, and bearing in his hand what would seem at the first glance to be a shepherd&#8217;s crook, only its handle is much longer, appears upon the pavement. He touches a number of windows with great quickness as he moves rapidly along. . . . The use of the long handle of his instrument becomes apparent as he proceeds, enabling him as it does to reach the upper windows of the dwellings whose inmates he has to rouse. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     The sentry in question, quitting the streets, and stooping through one of the small archways that we have before noticed, entered a court. Here lodged a multitude of his employers; and the long crook as it were by some sleight<sup>1</sup> of hand seemed sounding on both sides and at many windows at the same moment. Arrived at the end of the court, he was about to touch the window of the upper story of the last tenement, when that window opened, and a man, pale and care-worn and in a melancholy voice spoke to him.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;Simmons,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;you need not rouse this story any more; my daughter has left us.&#8221; . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;That&#8217;s a bad business,&#8221; said the watchman, in a tone not [without] sympathy.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;Almost as bad as for parents to live on their childrens&#8217; wages,&#8221; replied the man mournfully. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;It&#8217;s hard times for such as us,&#8221; said the man; and leaving the window open, he retired into his room.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     It was a single chamber of which he was the tenant. In the centre, placed so as to gain the best light which the gloomy situation could afford, was a loom. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     The man seated himself at his loom; he commenced his daily task.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;Twelve hours of daily labour at the rate of one penny each hour; and even this labour is mortgaged! . . . I cannot sell my loom,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;at the price of old firewood, and it cost me gold. It is not vice that has brought me to this, nor [laziness], nor [carelessness]. I was born to labour, and I was ready to labour. I loved my loom and my loom loved me. It gave me a cottage in my native village, surrounded by a garden of whose claims on my solicitude<sup>2</sup> it was not jealous. There was time for both. It gave me for a wife the maiden that I had ever loved; and it gathered my children round my hearth with plenteousness and peace. I was content: I sought no other lot. It is not adversity<sup>3</sup> that makes me look back upon the past with tenderness.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;Then why am I here? . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;It is that the Capitalist has found a slave that has supplanted<sup>4</sup> the labour and [cleverness] of man. Once he was an artizan: at the best, he now only watches machines; and even that occupation slips from his grasp, to the woman and the child.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><sup><span class=\"no-number\">1</span></sup><span class=\"no-number\"><em>sleight</em>: trick<br /><sup>2</sup><em>solicitude</em>: attention<br /><sup>3</sup><em>adversity</em>: difficulty<br /><sup>4</sup><em>supplanted</em>: replaced</span></p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\">Excerpt from <em>Sybil, or the Two Nations</em> by Benjamin Disraeli.

Many people moved. Machinery changed how goods were produced.</em></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     The history of the proletariat<sup>1</sup> in England begins with the second half of the last century, with the invention of the steam-engine and of machinery for working cotton. These inventions gave rise, as is well known, to an industrial revolution, a revolution which altered the whole civil society; one, the historical importance of which is only now beginning to be recognized. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     Before the introduction of machinery, the spinning and weaving of raw materials was carried on in the working-man&#8217;s home. Wife and daughter spun the yarn that the father wove or that they sold, if he did not work it up himself. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     So the workers vegetated throughout a passably comfortable existence, leading a righteous and peaceful life in all piety and probity;<sup>2</sup> and their material position was far better than that of their successors. They did not need to overwork; they did no more than they chose to do, and yet earned what they needed. . . .Their children grew up in the fresh country air, and, if they could help their parents at work, it was only occasionally; while of eight or twelve hours work for them there was no question. . . .</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     The first invention which gave rise to a radical<sup>3</sup> change in the state of the English workers was the jenny. . . . This machine was the rough beginning of the later invented mule, and was moved by hand. Instead of one spindle like the ordinary spinning-wheel, it carried sixteen or eighteen manipulated by a single workman. This invention made it possible to deliver more yarn than heretofore. . . . More weavers were needed, and weavers&#8217; wages rose. Now that the weaver could earn more at his loom, he gradually abandoned his farming, and gave his whole time to weaving. . . . It happened often enough that a single weaver earned two pounds a week at his loom. By degrees the class of farming weavers wholly disappeared, and was merged in the newly arising class of weavers who lived wholly upon wages, had no property whatever, not even the pretended property of a holding, and so became working-men, proletarians. Moreover, the old relation between spinner and weaver was destroyed. Hitherto, so far as this had been possible, yarn had been spun and woven under one roof. . . . Thus began with spinning and weaving that division of labour which has since been so infinitely perfected.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><sup><span class=\"no-number\">1</span></sup><span class=\"no-number\"><em>proletariat</em>: working class people; those who earn wages (often through manual labor)<br /><sup>2</sup><em>probity</em>: honesty; fairness<br /><sup>3</sup><em>radical</em>: fundamental</span></p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\">Excerpt from <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 </em>by Friedrich Engels.
